#Q2) Ask the user to enter a string. 
# Output the string one character at a time, 
# as well as (output) itâ€™s(the characters) position in the string. 

#Break down question:
# 1. Make User 
# 2. Make input field 
# 3. Ask user to input a string: Please enter a string: cats
        #  store user input
# 4. Print user input:
# 5. Output position of character / Output letter inputted

# username = "Maria"
# user_input = input(f"Hi {username}, Please enter a string: ")

# i = 0
# while i < len(user_input):
#     print(f"{i} {user_input[i]}")
#     i += 1

# Q3) Ask the user for a number and use this to generate a pyramid of that height.
# Ask user for number:
    # need - user / input field / type int - asking for number
# Print pyramid:
    # Should say - Pyramid size:
    # (show Pyramind with character) *
    #  Should iterarte through user input
    #  Height (output) = user input
    # User input not predefined = while loop

# pyramid = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

# i = 0
# while i < pyramid:
#     i +=1
#     print("*"*i)

# Q4) Ask the user for a number and use this to generate 
# a (different) pyramid of that height.
# Ask user for number:
    # need - user / input field / type int - asking for number
# Print pyramid:
    # Should say - Pyramid size:
    # (show Pyramind with character) *
    #  Should iterarte through user input
    #  Height (output) = user input 
    # Width input = empty string times user input + * times user input + empty string * user input
    # User input not predefined = while loop

# Three Loop Questions:
#1. What do I want to repeat?
#  -> 
#2. What do I want to change each time?
#  -> 
#3. How long should we repeat?
#  -> 
# user_input = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

# i = 0

# while i < user_input:
#     i += 1
